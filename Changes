  *** INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE - This module now is a plugin bundle which includes a
      MakeMaker plugin as well as a DynamicPrereq plugin.  Your dist.ini needs to
      change from [ApacheTest] to [@ApacheTest]
    - Reimplement using Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MakeMaker::Awesome. This avoids
      replacing the MakeMaker plugin and greatly simplifies things.
    - use Dist::Zilla::Plugin::DynamicPrereqs to require either mod_perl v1 if
      it is installed, otherwise mod_perl2.
